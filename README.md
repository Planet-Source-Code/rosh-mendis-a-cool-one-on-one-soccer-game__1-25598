### Description

A very fun to play one-on-one soccer game. You can play against either a friend or the computer. I haven't seen a soccer game written in VB yet so I thought I'd make one. I used a game library I made that has some functions that helps calculate collision detection and artifical intelligence. Feel free to use it in your own games - I hope you find it useful. This game is more of a fun game. It's a bit silly but nevertheless enjoyable. Please vote (what you think it deserves) and gives as much feedback as possible. I would like to know what you think of it.
